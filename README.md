# MapleStoryDetectionSampleGenerator
Generate Machine Learning Samples Object Detection In MapleStory
![](https://github.com/charlescao460/MapleStory_TFRecord_Preparer/blob/master/pictures/result.png)



# Performance
This generator can generate arbitrarily many annotated samples. All bounding boxes are precisely annotated based on rendering coordinates.

With [YOLOv4](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/master/cfg/yolov4-custom.cfg) and ~5000 samples, it can achieve 99.8%mAP in test set.

# Requirement
* Visual Studio 2019 v16.8 or above with .NET workload installed
* .NET 5.0 SDK (5.0.0 or above)

# Build
1. Clone this repository with submodules by </br> `git clone --recursive git@github.com:charlescao460/MapleStoryDetectionSampleGenerator.git`
2. Build `WzComparerR2/WzComparerR2.sln` (submodule MUST be built first)
3. Build `MapleStoryDetectionSampleGenerator.sln`

# Run
(Assuming assemblies are built with `Release` configuration. `Debug` configuration is similar)
1. Cd into executable directory: `cd MapleStory.MachineLearningSampleGenerator\bin\Release\net5.0-windows`
2. Run `MapleStory.MachineLearningSampleGenerator\bin\Release\net5.0-windows\WzComparerR2.exe`. Running `WzComparerR2.exe` will generate `Setting.config`, which is required for our MapRender.
3. Use `WzComparerR2.exe` to find the desired map you want to sample. Assuming `993134200.img` is the map you want in Limina.
4. Prepare your player PNGs in a directory. Since WzComparerR2 does not have Avatar supported inside MapRender, we have to draw player images in our post-processing steps. Player images should be transplant PNGs with only the player's appearance. You can get these PNGs by Photoshop or dump from [WzComparerR2.Avatar/Entry.cs](https://github.com/Kagamia/WzComparerR2/blob/master/WzComparerR2.Avatar/Entry.cs)(a little bit tricky). </br>Assuming `.\players` is the directory containing all images
5. Run ```.\MapleStory.MachineLearningSampleGenerator.exe -m 993134200 -x 5 -y 5 -f coco -o ".\output" --post --players ".\players"```</br>
This means run the sampler in map 993134200.img with every 5 pixels in X and every 5 pixels in Y, outputing COCO format, and drawing players in post processor. 

# Output Formats
## Tensorflow TFRecord
According to Tensorflow [official document](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/load_data/tfrecord#tfrecords_format_details), the output .tfrecord contains multiple [tf.train.Example](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/train/Example) in single file. With each example store in the following formats:

```
uint64 length
uint32 masked_crc32_of_length
byte   data[length]
uint32 masked_crc32_of_data
```
And
```
masked_crc = ((crc >> 15) | (crc << 17)) + 0xa282ead8ul
```
Each `tf.train.Example` is generated by [protobuf-net](https://github.com/protobuf-net/protobuf-net) according to Tensorflow [example.proto](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/example/example.proto)

## Darknet
Output directory structure:
```
data/
|---obj/
|   |---1.jpg
|   |---1.txt
|   |---......
|---obj.data
|---obj.names
|---test.txt
|---train.txt
```
`obj.data` contains 
```
classes=2
train=data/train.txt
valid=data/test.txt
names=data/obj.names
backup = backup/
```
And `obj.names` contains the class name for object. `test.txt` and `train.txt` contains samples for testing/training with ratio of 5:95 (5% of images in `obj/` are used for testing).

## COCO
Output directory structure:
```
coco/
|---images/
|   |---1.jpg
|   |---2.jpg
|   |---......
|---annotations/
|   |---instances_train2017.json
|   |---instances_val2017.json
```
The COCO json is defined as following:

Note that `segmentation` covers the area as the same as `bbox` does. No segmentation or masked implemented .
